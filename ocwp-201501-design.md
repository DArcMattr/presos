Scalable Vector Graphics

# Wait, whut?

Compared with raster graphics. The images we see are all made as a raster: like
a painting made on a giant piece of graph paper--here's a black square, a yellow
square, etc.

Doesn't scale at all well

# Ye Olden Tyme Graphics

Could give sharp graphics before more modern technologies:

Remember the old [Asteroids arcade game](http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=6939)?

# But still, what is it?

It's a variant of XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which is like human readable
binary. It describes images geometrically.

# Hand made
I had to make a quick and dirty layout diagram for a project I worked on, this
is the result:

* [truck-full.svg](image/201501-des/truck-full.svg)

# Made by a program
* [bg-eye.svg](image/201501-des/bg-eye.svg) From a site that Zeek worked on
  recently (<http://beautycon.com>)

# Tools
* [SVG Optimizer](http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-optimiser)

# Optimized

# Reading List
* [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/mega-list-svg-information/) Chris Coyier is
  on a mission to get SVG used more widely
* [Demosthenes](http://demosthenes.info/blog/970/Web-Developer-Reading-List-Introduction-to-SVG)
  Dudley Storey's reading list on how to work with SVG to replace things that
  Flash once did, and how to get Adobe Illustrator to produce efficient output
