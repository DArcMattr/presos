  <http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test>

All at once!

# Immersion

We're going to look at the Naked Theme, hosted at
<http://naked-wordpress.bckmn.com/>. It's made for people to study and learn
from.

---

What you need to know about PHP to understand what's in the Naked Theme:

* Comments

  The Naked Theme has extensive comments written about what is going on in all
  the pages and all the parts of the theme

* Control Structures

* Where to read up about these things

  * <http://php.net>
  * <http://stackoverflow.com>
  * <http://wordpress.stackexchange.com>

# WordPress functions

WordPress is written with PHP, and you'll need to learn the PHP functions that
WordPress uses, and how a theme is organized

Learning how to navigate the Codex is half the battle, as GI Joe would say.

* <http://codex.wordpress.org>

WordPress developers are working on a better approach to documenting how
WordPress does things, and the resulting site is:

* <http://developer.wordpress.org/reference/>

# Theme organization

<http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy>

# Underscores

# Checking Your Work

Is your theme made using the latest that WordPress has to offer? Is it put
together correctly?

WordPress Theme Check <https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/>

Every theme get gets hosted at WordPress.org has to pass these checks.

---

# Jumping In the Deep End

Take an old theme, and make it Theme Check stops complaining about it

Like the old Default Theme
